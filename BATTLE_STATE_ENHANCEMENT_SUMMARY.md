# Enhanced Battle State Tracking System

## Overview

I've successfully enhanced your Pokemon battle system with comprehensive battle state tracking capabilities. The system now tracks all aspects of battle progression and provides detailed analysis for strategic decision-making.

## New Features Added

### 1. Turn Count Tracking
- **Current turn number**: Tracks which turn the battle is on
- **Turn advancement**: Automatic progression with `advance_turn()`
- **Turn-based effects**: Automatically decrements duration-based effects

### 2. Weather Conditions
- **Weather types**: Support for all major weather conditions (Sun, Rain, Sandstorm, Hail, etc.)
- **Duration tracking**: Automatically tracks remaining turns for weather
- **Permanent weather**: Support for ability-based permanent weather
- **Weather effects**: Enhanced decision engine considers weather for move selection

```python
# Set weather
battle.set_weather(WeatherType.SUN, duration=5)

# Check weather
weather_info = battle.get_weather_info()
# Returns: {'type': 'sun', 'turns_remaining': 5, 'is_permanent': False}
```

### 3. Screen Effects
- **Screen tracking**: Light Screen, Reflect, and custom screen effects
- **Side-specific**: Tracks which side (ally/opponent) has which screens
- **Duration management**: Automatic countdown and expiration
- **Strategic integration**: Decision engine considers screens when calculating damage

```python
# Add screen effects
battle.add_screen_effect("Light Screen", 5, "ally")
battle.add_screen_effect("Reflect", 5, "opponent")

# Check active screens
ally_screens = battle.get_active_screens("ally")
```

### 4. Pokemon History Tracking

#### Allied Pokemon History
- **Switch tracking**: Records when Pokemon switch in/out
- **Move usage**: Complete history of moves used by each Pokemon
- **Damage tracking**: Tracks damage taken and dealt by each Pokemon
- **KO tracking**: Records which Pokemon were knocked out

#### Opponent Pokemon History
- **Same comprehensive tracking** as allied Pokemon
- **Pattern recognition**: Analyzes opponent move patterns for prediction

```python
# Switch Pokemon
battle.switch_pokemon(new_pokemon, "ally")

# Record moves and damage
battle.record_move_used("ally", "Fire Blast")
battle.record_damage("opponent", 85, 85)  # opponent takes 85, ally deals 85
```

### 5. Seen Opponent Moves
- **Move discovery**: Automatically tracks all moves the opponent has used
- **Usage frequency**: Counts how often each move is used
- **Pattern analysis**: Predicts likely next moves based on usage patterns
- **Strategic value**: Helps anticipate opponent strategy

```python
# Get opponent move analysis
patterns = battle.get_opponent_move_pattern()
# Returns move frequency, most used moves, recent patterns, etc.
```

## Enhanced Decision Engine

The decision engine now considers all battle state factors:

### Weather-Based Decisions
- **Fire moves**: 1.5x damage in sun, 0.5x in rain
- **Water moves**: 1.5x damage in rain, 0.5x in sun
- **Strategic timing**: Recommends moves that benefit from current weather

### Screen Considerations
- **Damage calculations**: Automatically adjusts for Light Screen/Reflect
- **Move type recommendations**: Suggests physical moves vs Light Screen, special vs Reflect

### Pattern Recognition
- **Opponent prediction**: Analyzes opponent move history to predict next move
- **Counter strategies**: Recommends moves effective against frequently used opponent moves
- **Predictability avoidance**: Small penalty for overusing the same moves

### Battle Phase Analysis
- **Early game**: Setup and positioning strategies
- **Mid game**: Aggressive trading and momentum
- **Late game**: Finishing moves and critical decisions
- **HP-based urgency**: Adjusts strategy based on Pokemon health levels

## Battle Analysis & Reporting

### Comprehensive Battle Reports
```python
from battle.battle_utils import create_battle_report

report = create_battle_report(battle_state)
print(report)
```

Reports include:
- Current Pokemon status and HP
- Weather and field conditions
- Battle phase analysis
- Type effectiveness summary
- Opponent move predictions
- Strategic recommendations

### Real-Time Analysis
```python
from battle.battle_utils import BattleStateAnalyzer

analyzer = BattleStateAnalyzer(battle_state)

# Get momentum analysis
momentum = analyzer.get_momentum_analysis()

# Predict opponent's next move
prediction = analyzer.predict_opponent_next_move()

# Analyze battle phase
phase = analyzer.get_battle_phase_analysis()
```

### Strategic Recommendations
```python
from battle.battle_utils import get_battle_recommendations

recommendations = get_battle_recommendations(battle_state)
for rec in recommendations['recommendations']:
    print(f"â€¢ {rec}")
```

## File Structure

### Core Files Modified/Added
1. **`battle/battle_state.py`** - Enhanced with comprehensive tracking
2. **`battle/decision_engine.py`** - Updated to use battle state information
3. **`battle/battle_utils.py`** - New utility functions for analysis and reporting

### Test Files
1. **`test_enhanced_battle_state.py`** - Tests all new tracking features
2. **`demo_enhanced_decision_engine.py`** - Demonstrates enhanced decision making
3. **`demo_battle_reports.py`** - Shows comprehensive battle analysis

## Usage Examples

### Basic Battle Setup
```python
from battle.battle_state import BattleState, WeatherType
from battle.decision_engine import recommend_move

# Create battle
battle = BattleState(my_pokemon, opponent_pokemon)

# Set conditions
battle.set_weather(WeatherType.RAIN, 8)
battle.add_screen_effect("Light Screen", 5, "ally")

# Get move recommendation
best_move = recommend_move(battle)
```

### Advanced Battle Analysis
```python
from battle.battle_utils import create_battle_report, BattleStateAnalyzer

# Generate comprehensive report
report = create_battle_report(battle)
print(report)

# Detailed analysis
analyzer = BattleStateAnalyzer(battle)
prediction = analyzer.predict_opponent_next_move()
print(f"Opponent likely to use: {prediction['prediction']}")
```

### Team Battle Management
```python
# Switch Pokemon and track history
battle.switch_pokemon(new_pokemon, "ally")

# View team performance
for pokemon_history in battle.ally_pokemon_history:
    print(f"{pokemon_history.pokemon.name}: {pokemon_history.damage_taken} damage taken")
```

## Benefits

1. **Strategic Depth**: Much more sophisticated battle decision-making
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Learn and adapt to opponent strategies
3. **Complete Tracking**: Never lose track of battle state or history
4. **Realistic Simulation**: Models actual Pokemon battle mechanics
5. **Extensible Framework**: Easy to add new battle mechanics or conditions

The enhanced battle state system transforms your Pokemon battle simulator from a basic move-selection tool into a comprehensive strategic battle engine that rivals the depth of the actual Pokemon games.
